This is the capstone project I had to work on for the Scrimba Learn React course.

This is a Meme Generator app. 

It allows the user to type up to two sentences that will be display on the top of the image, or on the bottom of the image. 

100 images are retrieved from an API, then the images randomly change every time the generate button is pressed.

I refatored the code to have React Hooks on it.
